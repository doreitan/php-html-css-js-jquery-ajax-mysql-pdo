1. Ovbjs.Html (Formatted with the Css File and Jquery)
The purpose of this file is to receive information from the user.

1.1 The Head Section

		1.2.2.9 Div - display results - displaying the results from database with php Ajax pdo and mySql
		


2. Javascript/Jquery
Even before sending the form a check is being preformed on ovb.js to see weather all necessary fields are fully given.
Firstname,lastname, Phone, Email
	2.1 The Javascript code:
		The return_validate_data Function checks to see if the above fields are not empty
		The form will not be able to be sent before these fields are correctly filled 
	2.2 function radio_select on Javascript - (Male /Female ) checks to see what has been selected)
   
	
	3. Jquery Code

3.1 All Fields will change Color when in focus.Jquery + Ajax + php + Sql (PDO)
3.2 All Fields will change Color when losing Focus
3.3 Email Field - after the User has entered his Email
	3.3.1 Email loses Focus = Blur
	3.3.2 The Email address that the user gave is being sent to Emailcheck.php (PDO)($.get('Emailcheck.php')
	to see if this Emails exists on database (Ajax+MySql) 
		  if the Email is found - (if data==0) this means that there aren't any other Emails like this in our database
		  and the program could go on. however if (data>0) it means that there is at least one email address (or more) similar to 
		  what the user has given. therefore: A message to the user to give a different Email will be display
		  on the div section of the HTML. the email field will still remain in Focus until the user changes it, The send button 
          will also won't be allowed, and a Red color will circle the Text Box (Firefox).
		  
4. return=true => ovbjs.php
	when everything goes fine, and no mistakes on the Html/js forms, the program will take us to the next stage
	this is the file ovbjs.php (was declared in the form-action on the HTML file. )
	4.1 transfering all variables from the POST into php variables after test_input (see bellow 4.11)
	4.2 checkbox - is that your first time on our site? ( $var = isset($_POST['firsttime']);)
	4.3 connecting to sql database with PDO (try-catch)
	4.4 Creating an Insert Query (SQL)
	4.5 Preparing the query
	4.6 binding
	4.7 executing
	4.8 putting the Object into Php Variable - $results
	4.9 closing the connection with the Database
	4.10 calling the next file with Header (registerjs.php)to display results
	    (p.s Of course wouldn't want the user to see the database - but this is just an exercise - we could always change the file in the 
	     header e.g welcome.php)
	4.11 function test_input($data) in order to get rid of unneccassary characters
	
5. registerjs.php displays the table with values from SQL inside HTML Formatted
	5.1 connecting to the database again - but this time with a Select query (pdo-sql)
